# Introduction

**What is an algorithm?**

In mathematics and computer science, an **algorithm** (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/) is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.

**What are data structures?**
In computer science, a **data structure** is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications
